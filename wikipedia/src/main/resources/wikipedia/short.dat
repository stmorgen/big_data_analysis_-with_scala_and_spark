Those supporting deletion successfully establish the lack of significant third-party coverage, yet those supporting keeping the article note the success of the business, while it does not make the subject ''inherently'' notable, contributes to an argument thereof, and some argue that there are sufficient sources for inclusion (e.g., Ktr101).

Several third party sources identify metrics which I wouldn't consider "trivial" or "incidental" as per [[WP:CORP|the notability guidline on corporations]] and could even be considered inherently notable, such as [http://finance.yahoo.com/news/beacon-roofing-acquire-mcclure-johnston-130251881.html;_ylt=A0LEVxM23VhU2OwAbvBXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEzY2RxajU3BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1ZJUDUzMl8x almost $100 in annual sales], [http://www.prosalesmagazine.com/news/distributors/beacon-roofing-supply-opens-location-no-200_o opening over 200 stores, recording almost $2 billion in total sales] and being a large, publicly traded company.

But I was unable to find anything in the article itself or this discussion so far that matched it, and the total there is not sufficient. GraniteSand's sources are warmed-over press releases. That the company is NASDAQ-listed does not in my experience demonstrate the existence of good coverage.  Still, with a $1B+ market cap, I would guess that coverage may still exist, yet to be found, perhaps in specialized industry periodicals. The topic ''may'' be able to show notability if a sufficiently informed editor has access to appropriate sources and builds an article from them.

No exclusion of analyst reports is made, and indeed it is specifically cited as material that conveys notability.  What you consider boring, routine stuff, people interested in business consider exciting.  Business writing normally covers financials (but note most such reports also give background info on what the company does) by people paid to cover financials.  That doesn't make it any less reliable or indepth - the actual notability requirements - nor does it make it indiscriminiate (business analsysts/reports do choose what they write about - no one blindly covers every company in existance!).

Later into the 1900s the Nepalese tea producers acted as suppliers to Darjeeling factories when tea bushes became old and yields decreased.<ref name=mishra/> Orthodox tea now provides a source of sustainability for almost 20 000 farmers in Nepal.<ref name=mishra/> Farmers are supported by the National Tea and Coffee Development Board created by the Nepalese Ministry of Agriculture.<ref name=ntcdb>NTCDB.

There is also that one still has to click on this section editing button, which could be avoided, especially considering the time it takes to load visual editor. So a way to save the changes without leaving visual editor would be most welcome. [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]] ([[User talk:Cenarium|talk]]) 06:05, 1 December 2014 (UTC)  [[User:Cenarium|Cenarium]], I think that you want the [[WP:keyboard shortcuts#List_of_access_keys|keyboard shortcuts]], which work anywhere on the page.

This link will show you the names of the objects that you want to change:  https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Candy&uselang=qqx  There is no way to skip the invitation to provide an edit summary, and I'm certain that this is a WONTFIX issue with the product manager.

I want to remain in visual editor mode after the save. I make edits, I save my edits without leaving visual editor, I edit again, and so on. It would make editing easier and faster, having to use shortcuts is too much of a hassle and it takes too long for visual editor to load. So I think it's a feature that would be very helpful and appreciated, particularly by experienced users. I would suggest a checkbox "stay in visual editor mode after saving". (I would even suggest to have a "visual editor always on" option in preferences, but only further down the line, when performance will have improved.) :Thanks, I know how to hide in css but not how to change a label, so I'll ask at VPT (and I'll update [[WP:CSS#Tips_and_tricks]]).

Is it not possible yet ? :I was not suggesting skipping the window as a feature request, but as something that 'power' users could do using personal js. I've thought of something better though : :I would strongly suggest to offer an option to have the edit summary window and minor edit checkbox (everything else is superfluous, or should be allowed to be hidden) together with the edit window, as in source editing. I see two possibilities, both could be offered and the user would choose according to their preference (mostly based on abundance of vertical space versus horizontal space on their respective platform). Either right below the visual editor menu toolbar, or in another box on the left side of the window where the navigation bar takes lots of unused space.

When working on an article, editors tend to make several edits in succession rather than a big one for several reasons, the main of those being edit conflicts. This would matter even more in visual editor since resolving conflicts would presumably require wikitext editing, which would defeat the purpose of said visual editor. So there should be a way to save without leaving, the visual editor window should update with the user's edit (and non-conflicting edits by other users). :::I've tried using custom js to reload the visual editor immediately after leaving it, as a script for wikitext editor does, but couldn't get js to work with visual editor, see section below.

Tiki taka is his playing style, one may say that the attacking middle fielder is not much of a dribbler but rather makes it up with accurate short passes that create scoring chances.  As a youth, he played for Set Green Hills academy, park center high school , PSC Soccer Academy and Prairie seeds academy.  Before joining FC Minneapolis Mumbo played with Portugal FC as a middle fielder.  He later on joined the Czechoslovakia side, SK Aritma Praha until when he suffered a fatal knee injury that saw him return to the US in the spring of 2014 to sign a Pro Transition Contract with FC Minneapolis.  "Mumbo is a promising player so full of football and mystery. I just can't wait to see what he's going to become here at FC Minneapolis" Smith said.  Due to his Brazilian playing style, Mumbo has been nick named Daudinho by the FC Minneapolis media, a title that fits him whenever he appears before the ball.  <ref>http://www.fcminneapolis.com/#!duadley-muambo/c1cyt</ref>  <ref>http://www.fcminneapolis.com/#!Will-Moore-and-Chen-Yifu-score-as-FC-Minneapolis-draws-with-Hazzelwood-Park/c11iu/45ED5E78-0594-4A91-B98E-2B99D0D4DDF6</ref></text></page>",

"<page><title>Maglekilde</title><text>[[Image:Maglekilde.JPG|thumb|200px|Maglekilde]] '''Maglekilde''' is the most powerful of several natural springs in [[Roskilde]], [[Denmark]]. It formerly issued water at a rate of some 90,000 litres per hour but has now dropped to 15,000 litres per hour. A wellhouse was built over the spring in 1927. It is now listed.  ==History==  ===Early history=== Extensive deposits of [[travertine]] from Maglekilde were mined and used as a building material before bricks became readily available. Several churches in the Rokilde area were built in travertine from the spring in the 11th and 12th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/da_DK/maglekilden-i-roskilde|title=Maglekilden I Roskilde|publisher=Kulturstyrelsen|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> This activity resulted in the formation of a pond which was used as a [[mill pond]]. The watermill at the site was called Maglekilde Watermill (''Maglekilde Mølle''). The water from the spring also powered five other watermills on its way to [[Roskilde Fjord]]: Vandhulsmølle, Sankt Mortens Mølle, Kapelsmøllen, Sankt Clara Mølle and Strandmøllen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roskildemuseum.dk/vores-viden/nyere-tid/fredede-huse-i-roskilde-og-lejre.aspx|title=Fredede huse i Roskilde og Lejre|publisher=Roskilde Museum|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> Maglekilde Watermill is first mentioned by name in 1258 but it most likely included in the [[prebendary|prebend]] of one of the [[canon (priest)|canon]]s at the [[cathedral chapter]] in 1253.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/1200/enkeltaar/1250-99/1253.htm|title=1264|publisher=Roskildes Historie|accessdate=13 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref>  ===Maglekilde Paper and Textile Mill=== On 8 April 1731, Maglekilde Watermill was the first of the buildings which were destroyed in the series of devastating fires that hit Roskilde in 1731.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roskildehistorie.dk/1700/billeder/bystyre/ildebrande/brand1.htmhtml|title=Brandene I 1731|publisher=Roskildes Historie|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> A new paper mill was built on the site in 1737<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fam-schuwendt.dk/onewebmedia/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Papirmagerne%20og%20Mundus%20familien.pdf|title=Papirmagerne og Mundus familien.|publisher=fam-schuwendt.dk|accessdate=11 January 2015|language=Danish}}</ref> and it was joined by a textile mill in 1761.

"<page><title>The Coolin</title><text>'''The Coolin''', or The Coolun, is an Irish air often characterised as one of the most beautiful in the [[Irish traditional music|traditional repertoire]].  In Irish, its name has been given as  ''An Chúileann'' or ''An Chúilfhionn'' ("the fair haired girl" or "the fair lady") depending on the text used. The tune is also known as "The Lady of the Desert".  ==History==  The air, and the texts fitted to it, have a long and very complex history. Its exact provenance is unknown, but it has been variously asserted by different authors as dating from the 13th century, from the time of [[Henry VIII]], or from the 17th century, though the latter is the most credible.<ref name=donnellan1112>Donnellan, L. "Traditional Irish and Highland Airs", in Quinn (ed.), ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol 3, no. 1 (1912), 11-12</ref> There are at least two main Irish language texts and a number of later English translations, or interpretations of both; there are also English words (such as those by [[Thomas Moore|Moore]]) which are not a translation of either Irish version.  ===The air===  The air itself is sometimes claimed to have been composed by [[Turlough O'Carolan|Carolan]], though John Glen (1900) said that the "ancient Irish melody" was in fact usually known as "Molly St George" at the beginning of the 18th century.<ref name=glen218>Glen, J. ''Early Scottish melodies: including examples from mss. and early printed works'', AMS, 1900, p.218</ref> The latter-named tune has been often been associated with the great 17th-century harper [[Thomas Connellan]]. Connellan was also cited alongside Carolan as a possible composer of The Coolin, but as Glen noted, many supposed "that the tune is older than either of them".<ref name="glen218"/>  The version of The Coolin printed by [[Edward Bunting]] in ''The Ancient Music of Ireland '' (1840) was taken from the playing of [[Donnchadh Ó Hámsaigh]] (Dennis Hempson), who himself claimed to have learned it from the playing of [[Cornelius Lyons]] early in the previous century. Though Bunting's setting claims to present the tune with variations, it in fact appears to print only Lyons' once-fashionable baroque variations while omitting the main tune.<ref name=jifss>''Journal of the Irish folk Song Society'', v1-2, Wm. Dawson, 1967, p.32</ref> [[Patrick Weston Joyce]], who said that Bunting's version was "wanting in simplicity", printed a version of the tune collected from the playing of a fiddler, Hugh O'Beirne, that he said was very similar to that he recalled being sung in his youth in 1830s [[County Limerick]].<ref name=joyce299>Joyce, ''Old Irish Folk Music and Songs'', 1909, p.299</ref>  Other versions appeared in several late 18th century collections, as well as in the 1795 opera ''The Wicklow Mountains'', written by [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keeffe]] with music by [[William Shield]].  ===Claimed 13th or 16th century origins===  These suggestions originated with [[Joseph Cooper Walker]], who said in his ''Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards'' (1786) that the air's title in fact referred to what he called the "coulins", or long locks of hair, worn by Irish men and which were prohibited by a statute of [[Henry VIII]], although he noted that no actual words to the air on this subject had survived.<ref name=walker134>Walker, J. C. ''Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards'', Payne, 1786, p.134</ref> Despite the lack of a text, Walker's assertion was repeated by, amongst others, [[Laurence F. Renehan|Renehan]] and [[W. H. Grattan Flood]]: Flood however proposed (based on a suggestion by Lynch in a letter to the ''Dublin Penny Journal'') the air must refer to an earlier statute of the 13th century. The story inspired a 19th-century patriotic poem called ''The Coulin Forbidden'', written by W. B. McBurney under the pseudonym "Carroll Malone".  [[File:Eugene OCurry-Social England 1904-p889-with-header.jpg|thumbnail|right|The distinguished philologist [[Eugene O'Curry]] believed that the air known as The Coolin was first given that name in the early 18th century by a Fr. Oliver O'Hanley.]]  The philologist [[Eugene O'Curry]] asserted, however, that the title "The Coolin" was only applied to the air in the 18th century after it was used by a priest, Fr. Oliver O'Hanley, to set a poem he wrote in praise of a famous beauty of [[County Limerick]].<ref name=griffin>O'Curry, E. Note XXVI to Griffin, G. ''The Invasion'', 1895, p.586</ref> In this case, O'Curry commented, the word "Coolin" is used in its sense "fair-haired one", to refer to a girl: he disagrees with Walker, stating "no such word was ever, or ever could have been, applied to the ''glibbs'', or long tufts of back hair, prohibited by old English statute".<ref name="griffin"/>  The Rev. L. Donnellan, in a survey of the various texts and tunes of The Coolin, published in the 1912 ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', was equally dismissive: he states that Walker's "credulous" story of it referring to an English statute was "fabricated by his friend [William] Beauford".<ref name=donnellan1112>Donnellan, L. "Traditional Irish and Highland Airs", in Quinn (ed.), ''Journal of the County Louth Archaeological Society'', vol 3, no. 1 (1912), 11-12</ref> He also notes that what he called Walker's "foolish speculation" was encouraged by his insertion of the phrase "glibbs and coulins" into the 16th century statute, which he notes only refers to proscribed "glibbs".<ref name="donnellan1112"/> Donnellan's conclusion was that the original composition was a 17th-century one attributed to O Duagain (see below).  ===Text attributed to O Duagain===  The oldest and best-known Irish text definitely associated with the tune is a love-poem addressed to a fair-haired girl (''chúilfhionn''); this is attributed to a poet called Muiris O Duagain or Maurice O'Dugan of [[Benburb]] and said to have been written in around 1641.<ref name=hardiman>Hardiman, James. ''Irish minstrelsy, or Bardic remains of Ireland'', v.1, 1831, p.349</ref> English translations of this text have been written by Sir [[Samuel Ferguson]] (beginning "O have you seen the Coolun") and [[Thomas Furlong (poet)|Thomas Furlong]], amongst others. The latter was printed by [[James Hardiman]], along with O Duagain's original text, in his collection ''Irish Minstrelsy'' (1831).  A version of O Duagain of Benburb's poem was also printed, with translations, in [[Douglas Hyde]]'s ''Love Songs of Connacht'' (1893), with the first line ''A's éirigh do shuidhe a bhuachaill a's gleus dam mo ghearrán'' ("And rise up lad, and get ready for me my nag"). Hyde omits two stanzas already printed by Hardiman, and describes this as a version collected in [[Connacht]].<ref name=hyde>Hyde, ''Love Songs of Connacht'', 1893, pp.69-70</ref>  Donnellan, after dismissing Walker, Grattan Flood and O'Curry's other suggestions, states that the probability "is that O'Dugan of Benburb did compose a poem with this air perhaps substantially the same as the different versions given by Hardiman, Vol. I., p. 251 ; O'Daly, p. 155 ; and Dr. Hyde, pp. 70-73 in the ''Love Songs of Connacht''".<ref name="donnellan1112"/>   ===Text attributed to O'Hanley===  Writing in the early 1800s, O'Curry said that the title "The Coolin" was first applied to the air in the 18th century after it was used by a poet, Father Oliver O'Hanley (fl. 1700-1750), to set an Irish-language poem he had written in praise of Nelly O'Grady, a celebrated beauty of [[County Limerick]].<ref name="griffin"/> This text, beginning ''Ceó meala lá seaca, ar choilltibh dubha baraighe'' ("A honey mist on a day of frost, in a dark oak wood"), and which is addressed to ''Neilidh'' ("Nelly") was printed by Hyde, who said it was written in a manuscript originating in [[County Clare]], though the manuscript was partly damaged and he could not read two stanzas.<ref name="hyde"/>  ===Other texts===  Hyde noted the existence of what he called a Munster version of the poem, given in O'Daly's ''The poets and poetry of Munster'' (1850).<ref name="hyde"/> This shares some material with that attributed to O Duagain, but is only three stanzas long and includes a reference to a member of the Power family.<ref name=odaly>O'Daly, J. ''The Poets and Poetry of Munster: A Selection of Irish Songs by the Poets of the Last Century'', 1850, pp.124-125</ref>  Another well-known text was written for the air in English by the poet [[Thomas Moore]], usually known by its first line ''Though the last glimpse of Erin''. It is not a translation of any of the earlier Irish versions. Donnellan noted that the version of the air used by Moore was substantially "correct and unaltered", particularly in comparison to Bunting's, when compared with early 19th and late 18th century copies of the tune, though it still showed some evidence of having been adapted by an "instrumentalist".<ref name=donnellan12>Donnellan, 12, 13</ref>  ==Text==  The following is the early 19th century translation of O Duagain's text by Ferguson:  :O have you seen the Coolun, :Walking down the cuckoo's street, :With the dew of the meadow shining :On her milk-white twinkling feet! :My love she is, and my ''coleen oge'', :And she dwells in Bal'nagar; :And she bears the palm of beauty bright, :From the fairest that in Erin are.  :In Bal'nagar is the Coolun :Like the berry on the bough her cheek; :Bright beauty dwells for ever :On her fair neck and ringlets sleek; :Oh, sweeter is her mouth's soft music :Than the lark or thrush at dawn, :Or the blackbird in the greenwood singing :Farewell to the setting sun.  :Rise up, my boy! make ready :My horse, for I forth would ride, :To follow the modest damsel, :Where she walks on the green hillside; :Where since our youth were we plighted, :In faith, troth, and wedlock true - :She is sweeter to me nine times over, :Than organ or cuckoo!  :For, ever since my childhood :I loved the fair and darling child; :But our people came between us, :And with lucre our pure love defiled; :Ah, my woe it is, and my bitter pain, :And I weep it night and day, :That the ''coleen bawn'' of my early love, :Is torn from my heart away.  :Sweetheart and faithful treasure, :Be constant still and true; :Nor for want of herds and houses :Leave one who would ne'er leave you, :I'll pledge you the blessed Bible, :Without and eke within, :That the faithful God will provide for us, :Without thanks to kith or kin.   :Oh, love, do you remember :When we lay all night alone, :Beneath the ash in the winter storm :When the oak wood round did groan? :No shelter then from the blast had we, :The bitter blast or sleet, :But your gown to wrap about our heads, :And my coat around our feet.<ref name=ferguson>''The Book of Irish Ballads: Edited by Denis Florence M'Carthy'', James Duffy, 1846, p.188</ref>  ==Historic performances==  The Coolin was a popular part of the Irish harp repertoire of the 18th century. [[Charles Fanning (harper)|Charles Fanning]] won first prize at the [[Belfast Harp Festival]] of 1792 with a performance of The Coolin, repeating his success at the earlier [[Granard]] harp festivals with the same tune.<ref name=aoneill>[http://billhaneman.ie/AIH/MemoirsOfArthurONeill.html The Memoirs of Arthur O'Neill], Chapter XVI</ref> Bunting appears to have disapproved of Fanning's performance at Belfast, noting that he "was not the best performer, but he succeeded in getting the first prize by playing 'The Coolin' with modern variations, a piece of music at the time much in request by young practitioners on the piano-forte".<ref name=oneill>Bunting, quoted in O'Neill, F. ''Irish Minstrels and Musicians'', 1913, p.84</ref>  After the decline of Irish harping in the early 19th century, the air became equally popular as an instrumental piece with fiddle players and [[uilleann pipes|pipers]]. Recordings of The Coolin exist by [[Leo Rowsome]], [[Johnny Doran]] and [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]], amongst others.  ==Samuel Barber setting==  The composer [[Samuel Barber]] published a setting of The Coolin in 1942 for unaccompanied chorus, based on a text originally published by [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] in the collection ''Reincarnations''.<ref name=heyman182>Heyman, B. ''Samuel Barber'', OUP, 1992, p.182</ref> Stephens said that his poem, "The Coolun", was based on another by "[[Antoine Ó Raifteiri|Raftery]]",<ref name=stephens>Stephens, ''Reincarnations'', Macmillan, 1918</ref> but seems to bear some similarity to parts of the O'Hanley text ''Ceó meala lá seaca, ar choilltibh dubha baraighe''.  ==References==  {{reflist}}  [[Category:Irish songs]] [[Category:Year of song unknown]] {{DEFAULTSORT:Coolin}}</text></page>",
